COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization
This project explores and visualizes global COVID-19 data to uncover trends, compare countries, and evaluate vaccination efforts. The analysis focuses on Algeria, American Samoa, and Andorra using Python, with the goal of deriving insights and presenting findings through clean visualizations.

Project Objectives:
1. Clean and preprocess COVID-19 data (from Our World in Data)
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on selected countries
3. Visualize case trends, death rates, and vaccination progress
4. Generate insights into the pandemic's global and country-level impact

Tools and Libraries Used:
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Pandas – for data manipulation and cleaning
Matplotlib – for static plotting
Seaborn – for statistical data visualization
Geopandas (optional) – for geospatial mapping
